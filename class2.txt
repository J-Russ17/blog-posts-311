I organize my JS by keeping multiple folders/files so I don't have just one main.js file


My workflow usually starts with brainstorming how I want to go about a project,
next I make up some psuedo-code so I have an idea of the logic I want to use, 
then I turn that psuedo-code into real JS.


When I can't work out a problem on my own I either go to W3Schools, MDN, JS311 Textbook, or ChatGPT


The text editor I prefer the most is VS Code but that is probably due to the fact it is the only I have used.


I could definitely do a better job keeping up with the latest developments of the web,
the way I do that now is usually through YouTube videos or news articles
